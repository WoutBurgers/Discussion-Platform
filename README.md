This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project

## How to run it

.jar files can be run via the command line with the command: \
`java -jar <name_of_the_file>`

The app was primarily developed on Windows hence some functionalities may work only partially or not work
at all in other operating systems.

### Client

Select the .jar file from distributions/client corresponding to your operating system and run it.

### Server

Run the server.jar file from distributions/server. No setup is needed.
