# Code of Conduct #

1. If you disagree with something or want to know the reason behind something relating to the project, simply ask the person responsible. 
2. In the case of personal conflict with a group-member, work it out with someone from the group present as a mediator. 
3. Keep everyone informed, at least on a conceptual level, how everything you code operates. 
4. Make sure to add coherent comments to your code, explaining what methods and variables do. 
5. Use the American naming standard (i.e: color instead of colour).
6. Use clear variable names and full words in camelCase where possible. Abbreviations are okay if they are unambiguous to everyone. When using abbreviations, include their meaning in the comments. 
7. Be present for scheduled meetings. If you can’t make it to a meeting, let the other members know at most 24 hours beforehand, with the exception of emergencies. 
8. If you can’t make a deadline for whatever reason, let the group members know why, and try to give a time when you will be done. 
9. By default, deadlines are set on Sunday 23:59, so we have Monday to review any issues that may arise. 
10. If a group member fails to meet a deadline without a valid reason, they will be reminded by the rest of the group. If this member fails to meet a deadline a second time, the TA will be contacted. 
11. Try to avoid any controversial topics, and cut off a conversation if it starts turning into an argument or conflict. 
12. Merge requests must be approved by at least 2 other people. 
13. Any major decision regarding the project has to be discussed with the whole group present. Major decisions include: 
    - Distribution of workload
    - What features to implement
    - Handing in assignments
14. Feel free to ask for help from group members if you are stuck on something, but make sure not to take over someone else’s work.  
15. Try to check the discord every day for any announcements/requests/updates.
16. Try to have a second meeting each Thursday or Saturday.
