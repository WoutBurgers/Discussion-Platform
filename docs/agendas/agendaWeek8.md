## Opening

## Approval of the agenda

Version 6.9 of what is this point

## Points of action

- Go over productivity of this week
- Decide workflow next week

## Action points for next week

- Continue to work as planned

## Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), they should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

## Questions for the TA

- We have noticed other groups are simply doing a survey/checklist style Heuristic Evaluation. Are we interpreting the assignment wrong or are they?
- Could you share the statistics regarding our repository with is (i.e. commits, lines of code contributed by everyone) or is there a way for us to access this ourselves?
- What exactly is expected of the email about the total amount of commits?

## Question round

*If there are any other questions, now is the time to ask them.*

## Closing
