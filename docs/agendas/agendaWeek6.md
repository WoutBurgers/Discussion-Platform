# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

	- Continue to work on the project. Exact details to be determined.

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the CTA

```
- The format of the executable (exe or jar?)
- Is the software supposed to be cross-platform?
- Restart button functionality - restart or close room?
- Resizability of the application window
```



# Questions for the TA

	- Can we submit a second draft of the design document? (2nd review before final doc)
	- What type of executable does gradle automatically build (is it cross-platform?)
	- What should we work on this week?
