# Notes

## What needs to be done for the next meeting

 -Work on client side functionality with high priority(upvoting, deleting or asking a question)
 -Add functionality to the endpoints so more local changes can be communicated to other users

## What's happening on the next TA meeting

 - Discuss our work
 - Ask questions

## What happened on previous meetings

Week 1 - First meeting. General meet and greet + a bit of insight on the project.

Week 2 - Our first meeting with the CTA. Collecting information and requirements for the project.

Week 3 - Code of conduct review with the TA. Backlog/requirements update from the CTA.

Week 4 - Discussion of the next step, making the UI. Using JavaFX to create a start of the UI as UI is expected to take longer

Week 5 - Main discussion points where the advantages/disadvantages of Scene Builder compared to creating  the UI programatically and ways to implement resizing

## Last Q&A with the CTA

**Q** : What is the purpose of the restart button?
**A** : Its purpose is to delete all questions and "refresh" the state of a session so it can be reused for another lecture. Also it's not really necessary if our program supports multiple sessions

**Q** : Should we make sure to create an exectubale for every major OS?
**A** : The executable should be a .JAR file that works on every platform that has Java. As long as the TA can run it somewhere, it is perfectly fine

**Q** : How do we know we are on schedule right now?
**A** : A workable app that can connect back-end to front-end and also has some client-side functionality is a good indicator we are on schedule

**Q** : What does support for creating a scheduler actually imply?
**A** : It means creating the code for a room beforehand, while also implementing a pop-up window that communicates to students the session hasn't started

**Q** : How much effort should we put into making the app secure?
**A** : There id no requirement for making the app secure, so it is not really something we should focus on

**Q** : Does banning users also imply that all of their questions are deleted automatically?
**A** : It shouldn't be the case. If moderators want to delete a banned user's questions, they should do it manually

## What happened during our meeting with the TA
 -Discussed about the Design Document and ways to improve it
 -Also talked about the possibility of a second review for the Design Document

## Recommandations for next week
 - Support dynamic data, there should now be interactivity between users(i.e. a user should be able to upvote other users' questions)
 - Improve  on the UI and the way it responds to changes made by users
