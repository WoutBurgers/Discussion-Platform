# Notes

## What needs to be done for the next meeting

 -Communication 2/3 people (but this is already done)
 -UI programmatic (scene builder could work but has limits) 
   - Make classes and connect them with methods/functions
   - Prompts and passing parameters can be done with 1 function

 -Sim builder is easy to start with but it has it limits and is a pain to change.

 -Some issues could be split in multiple issues and add user stories
