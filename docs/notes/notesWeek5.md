## Notes 09-03 week 5

Notetaker: Hidde Boukens

Meeting started, main point of action is to decide workflow for this week

#### Question round

Question to TA: What are the differences between simbuilder and JavaFX

A: simbuilder generates fxml code. Like object injection, linking fxml to objects you have created. You can also do this by hand. Advise is to create UI objects and classes i.e. a dialogue class.

Reason for not using simbuilder is that if you want to do something that simbuilder can't do, you have to spend more time converting your other work to code to make it work.

Q: Any advise regarding the work. Reply: What have you done so far? A: We made login screen and a start to a student and mod view for the UI. 

After discussing and showing different UI designs, answer to do next: create a connection to our frontend, make it responsive to an extent

Q: Is there a somewhat simple solution to making the windows resizable. Reply: What ways have you find so far. Answer: don't remember exactly, but it didn't seem to be worth it, as the main goal was to get a working UI. 

A: Instead of working with pixels, you can work with ratio's and percentages. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36393170/javafx-layout-based-on-percentage-of-window-size)

Q: Will we be needing different executable files for different Operating Systems

A: The frontend will probably run from a .jar file, which is universal across every OS as long as it has Java

#### Additional notes

Note from TA: add a "What are we doing" to the retrospective. A form of action points addressing what went bad and what we are going to do to fix this.
