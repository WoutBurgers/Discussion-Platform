#### What happened this meeting

##### Q&A with TA

Q: What test coverage should we aim for

A: Back-end the aim is 80% test coverage. Front-end testing is hard, we can attempt but it's not necessary

##### Demo of our progress so far

Feedback for copying student/mod code from the pop-up: use a text-field, style it the same as background and make it not possible to edit it.



Comment from TA: Imbalance between commits and how many everyone contributes. For now it's not pressing yet, but we should work on balancing out the amount of commits among all group members.
